# Netflix-dataset-EDA

# Recommendations -
1. Netflix should add more TV Shows as the percentage of this content type is very less
2. Since we see drastic decrease in number of movies added after 2018, Netflix should try adding more movies mostly in genres like Thrillers, Romance, Family drama which is less compared to other types on the platform
3. In India, Netflix should consider adding more women cast movies/shows or more South movies so that even south indian audience can cater to their taste of movies
4. Overall, there is much more content for a more mature audience rated content. So Netflix should add more content from other ratings as well so ALL age groups can spend time on Netflix
5. Most movies have been added in Nov, Dec, Jan months, so Producer should try selling to Netflix during this time
